# light-darkmode-toggle

## Info

Hello reader. This was taken from a youtube video so that I could learn how to to do it, understand how it works, and use it for any coding projects I may want to add it to.

What is important to use for the success of this repo are to copy the class names in the HTML, the CSS and IMPORTANTLY, the Javascript.

There is not any localstorage for this to make the app remember if the user wants to keep light or dark mode. There might be some added in the future. Stay tuned.
